The "xappy" python module is an easy-to-use interface to the Xapian search
engine. Xapian provides a low level interface, dealing with terms and
documents, but not really worrying about where terms come from, or how to build
searches to match the way in which data has been indexed. In contrast, "xappy"
allows you to design a field structure, specifying what kind of information is
held in particular fields, and then uses this field structure to index data
appropriately, and to build and perform searches.

Xappy is not yet stable - in particular, both the API and database format will
change in future releases.   If you wish to use it, we recommend that you
subscribe to the xappy-discuss mailing list (see
http://groups.google.com/group/xappy-discuss) to keep up-to-date with changes
to Xappy.
