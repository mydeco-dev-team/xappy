Firstly, check out xappy:

    svn co http://xappy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk xappy
    cd xappy/

Check it's working properly, if you like:

    python testsuite/runtests.py

Now, go into the performance test directory:

    cd perftest/
    mkdir sampledata

The following  instructions assume you're on atreus.tartarus.org.  On other
machines, you'll need to get the wikipedia data, and process it into a
"scriptindex" dump format.  This can be done using the
"parse_wikipedia/wiki2dump.py" script inside the perftest directory (you can
just ignore the "redirects output file").

Link to the wikipedia sample data:

    ln -s /home/richard/pub/data/wikipedia_processed/out_splitaa sampledata/wikipedia.dump
     (or use split_ab for a small piece of data)

Generate some sample queries (the source data is in ../testdata - could do with
better source data):

    python gen_queries.py
    mv ../testdata/queries.txt sampledata/

Finally, run the performance tests:

    python perftest.py

The output will be placed in "perftestoutdir/"
