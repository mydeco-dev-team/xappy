How to sort a database:

First, you need to build a database with the value in a particular value slot.
For example, if you have a field with action "WEIGHT", and field name "weight",
the weight values will be stored in a slot named "weight" with purpose
"weight".

Next, you need to build a file holding the order into which the documents
should be sorted.  This is done by running:

 python make_order.py [db_path] [fieldname] [purpose] [output file]

For example:

 python make_order.py unsorted_db weight weight orderfile


Next, you need to run the sortdatabase program.  This can be compiled using the
makefile in this directory, as long as the "xapian-compat" command is on your
PATH.  This is run as:

 ./sortdatabase [db_path] [order file] [temporary directory] [output_db_path]

Where [order file] is the output of the "make_order.py" command, [temporary
directory] is a temporary directory to write work files to (note - this must
exist and be empty before the run), and [output_db_path] is the path that the
final, sorted, database should be written to.

The XAPIAN_FLUSH_THRESHOLD environment variable has an effect on this command -
you should set it to a high value if you have lots of memory.

For example:

 rm -rf tmpdir
 mkdir tmpdir
 XAPIAN_FLUSH_THRESHOLD=100000 ./sortdatabase unsorted_db orderfile tmpdir sorted_db
