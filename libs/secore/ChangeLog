Thu Jul 26 17:02:33 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* secore/datastructures.py: Warn early if a field is too long:
	  we might be able to replace this by hashing if necessary, but
	  this is better than waiting for the xapian error in this case.

Wed Jul 25 08:37:51 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* docs/introduction.rst: Add documentation on indexing and
	  searching facets.

Wed Jul 25 03:06:19 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* secore/searchconnection.py: Correct small initialisation bug.

Wed Jul 25 01:53:51 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* secore/: Change string marshalling to use xapian's stuff; cuts
	  down code, uses a more compact representation, and is compatible
	  with the facet range calculation stuff.  Update tests to cover
	  the facet calculation stuff in more detail (but still need more
	  coverage).  Fix bug with converting string range to a numeric
	  range more than once if get_suggested_facets is called
	  repeatedly.

Tue Jul 24 10:32:56 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* secore/fieldactions.py,secore/searchconnection.py,
	  secore/searchconnection_doctest2.txt: Add the "FACET" action, to
	  store facets for field search and facet selection.  Still
	  remaining is to change the serialisation of floats to match
	  Xapian to make the numeric range calculation work correctly,
	  translate the resulting numeric ranges into a more suitable
	  python representation, and handle multiple values for a
	  particular facet being specified for a single document.

Mon Jul 23 10:59:58 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* docs/introduction.rst,secore/searchconnection.py: Add special
	  value of -1 for checkatleast parameter, to check all matches, and
	  document it (and the general reason for setting the checkatleast
	  parameter when using get_top_tags()).

Mon Jul 23 10:40:22 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* secore/: Add missing synonym stuff.

Tue Jul 17 13:42:39 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* docs/introduction.rst,secore/fieldactions.py,
	  secore/searchconnection.py: Add some documentation of tags, and
	  fix a couple of bugs.

Tue Jul 17 13:25:10 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* secore/fieldactions.py,secore/searchconnection.py: Add support
	  for tagging - as yet, undocumented, and minimally tested.

Mon Jul 16 11:32:18 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* secore/searchconnection.py: Check for KeyError when getting a
	  slot number for a range restriction, too.

Mon Jul 16 11:18:36 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* secore/searchconnection.py: Check for KeyError when accessing
	  list of field actions, and behave as if an empty list was found
	  if the field is unknown.

Fri Jul 13 16:39:50 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* secore/searchconnection.py: Add an option to query_filter to
	  return only those documents which _don't_ match the filter,
	  instead of those which do.
	* secore/searchconnection_doctest2.txt: Add a test for using a
	  filter with exclude=True.

Mon Jul 09 11:23:56 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* secore/searchconnection.py: Convert supplied sequence of queries
	  to list, since xapian query constructor isn't happy to take an
	  iterator.

Fri Jul 06 16:38:11 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* secore/indexerconnection.py: Fix bug in replace() causing the
	  document data not to be stored.

Wed Jul 04 17:24:40 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* docs/introduction.rst,perftest/index_from_dump.py,secore/:
	  Change all occurrences of unique_id to just "id" - no need to say
	  the unique bit, so it's just wasted typing.

Mon Jul 02 09:08:39 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* secore/searchconnection.py: If a search connection is opened
	  before the fieldmappings file has been created, give it an empty
	  FieldMappings object.  Also, fix a bug in handling of
	  checkatleast.

Sun Jul 01 18:13:34 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* secore/searchconnection.py: Add query_all(), to make a search 
	  matching all documents in the database.

Fri Jun 29 09:36:49 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* secore/searchconnection.py: Encode correctly spelt queries in UTF8,
	  for consistency with output of Xapian.
	* secore/searchconnection_doctest2.txt: Test spelling correction
	  with unicode strings.

Fri Jun 29 09:00:14 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* secore/indexerconnection_doctest3.txt,
	  secore/searchconnection_doctest2.txt: Improve test coverage.

Fri Jun 29 08:47:34 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* docs/introduction.rst,secore/: Finally, properly implement and
	  document the spelling correction support.

Thu Jun 28 23:33:06 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* docs/introduction.rst: Fix documentation of parameters to
	  INDEX_FREETEXT, and adjust an example to give expected output
	  after recent fix to highlighting.
	* secore/fieldactions.py: Add an option allowing indexing without
	  positional information, and an option allowing indexing with
	  spelling correction.
	* secore/highlight.py,secore/searchconnection_doctest1.txt: Update
	  output of examples to match recent fix to highlighting.

Thu Jun 28 15:26:36 BST 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* secore/fieldactions.py: Add stopwording, and an option not to
	  store prefixed terms, to freetext indexing.
	* secore/highlight.py: Fix a bug causing the requested maxlength to
	  be exceeded if the derived blocks were too big.

Fri Jun 08 15:37:21 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* AUTHORS,testdata/query_sourcewords.txt: Add source words for
	  generating queries to test with, and list the copyright holders
	  in AUTHORS.

	  and analysing the logs of these tests.

	  dumps of wikipedia data into scriptindex compatible forms.

Wed May 16 20:03:02 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* Remove textprocessor.py in favour of using the new TermGenerator
	  stuff in Xapian 1.0.0.  Implement sorting by date or floating
	  point.  Add query_range() method for searching all documents in a
	  given range.
