#!/bin/sh -e
# This script is used to generate the tarballs of xapian for xappy.
#
# These tarballs are based on SVN HEAD, but with the changes from two branches
# merged in.  Some of the contents of these branches may be merged into HEAD
# shortly, but other changes on the branches can't easily be merged to HEAD
# during the 1.0.x release series, so will be merged after the 1.0.x series has
# been moved into maintenance mode, and HEAD is being used to work towards the
# 1.1 series.
#
# The script depends on various directories being set up, and is probably only
# usable on my machine without a fair bit of work first.

# The directories used are:
#
#  $basedir/branchpoints/matchspy: a checkout of the matchspy branch at the
#  revision the branch was made (ie, before any changes were made on it).
#
#  $basedir/branchpoints/opsynonym: a checkout of the opsynonym branch at the
#  revision the branch was made (ie, before any changes were made on it).
#
#  $basedir/branchpoints/clustering: a checkout of the clustering branch at the
#  revision the branch was made (ie, before any changes were made on it).
#
#  $basedir/branches/matchspy: a checkout of the matchspy branch at the latest
#  revision.
#
#  $basedir/branches/opsynonym: a checkout of the opsynonym branch at the
#  latest revision.
#
#  $basedir/branches/clustering: a checkout of the clustering branch at the
#  latest revision.
#
#  $basedir/head/trunk: a checkout of HEAD, at the latest revision.
#
#  $xappylibdir: a checkout of xappy/trunk.
